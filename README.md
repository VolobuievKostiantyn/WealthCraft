## 🪙 WealthCraft
A Financial Education Game for Android

WealthCraft is an open-source Android game that teaches players the fundamentals of personal finance, investing, and passive income through interactive simulation.

Players take on the role of everyday professionals navigating jobs, expenses, opportunities, and investments — with the ultimate goal of achieving financial freedom. The game encourages strategic thinking about money, risk, and long-term planning.

🔥 Unique Feature: Player-Customizable Financial World

"Dynamic Sandbox Economy"
Allow players to create, edit, or remove in-game entities — such as professions, investments, expenses, assets, life events — to simulate their own real-life financial situations or experiment with custom scenarios.

🧩 How It Works:

Players can define:
- Custom jobs (income, taxes, time costs)
- Assets/investments (cost, ROI, risk)
- Liabilities (loans, recurring expenses)
- Life events (randomized or scripted: inheritance, layoff, market crash)
- Financial goals (retire early, buy a house, start a business)

🌍 Why It’s Unique:

Most financial games are static — WealthCraft becomes a living economic sandbox, empowering users to:
- Simulate their own life choices
- Recreate real economies or scenarios (e.g., 2023 inflation, startup founder path)
- Share custom scenarios with friends or community
- Learn by modifying variables and observing impact
